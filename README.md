*__UPDATE June 2018__*

It is now possible to run the analysis in parallel which can fasten considerably the computation for large datasets (it does not a significant difference for small datasets or when mapping is not requested).

The example below run the evaluation in 4 cores in parallel.

```
data(Malagasy.amphibian)
MyResults <- IUCN.eval(Malagasy.amphibian, parallel=T, NbeCores=4, DrawMap=T)
```
